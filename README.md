# work-day-scheduler

## Description
This project is a day planner designed for those in the workspace to be able to look at their day at a glance. The deployed application can be viewed here: https://rdatkinson.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
When the user opens the application, at the top they will see the current day listed. Going down the page, they will see individual blocks for the hours 9am-5pm. These blocks will change colour depending on the time of day viewed to indicate wether they are in the past, it is the present hour or if it is later on in the day. For example, here is how the page would look if viewed at 12pm:

The user can write in each of the time blocks things that they have to do that day or meetings to be attended. If they hit the save button, then the text they have inputted will stay there even if the page is refreshed.
